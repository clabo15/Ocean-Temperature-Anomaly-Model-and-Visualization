# Ocean Temperature Anomaly Model and Visualization

## Overview
This project models historical ocean temperature anomalies, forecasts future anomalies, and visualizes the data using C++ and Python. It uses a linear regression approach to analyze trends and predict future temperature deviations relative to a baseline.

## Mathematical Model: Linear Regression
Linear regression is used in this project to identify the relationship between two variables:
- **Independent Variable (x)**: Year
- **Dependent Variable (y)**: Temperature anomaly

### Linear Regression Equation
The model fits a line through the data points using the following equation:

$$
y = mx + b
$$

- **\( m \)**: Slope of the line (rate of change)
- **\( b \)**: Y-intercept (value of \( y \) when \( x \) is 0)
- **\( y \)**: Predicted temperature anomaly
- **\( x \)**: Year

### Calculating the Slope and Intercept
The slope \( m \) and intercept \( b \) are computed using the following formulas:

1. **Mean of \( x \) (\(\bar{x}\)) and \( y \) (\(\bar{y}\))**:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}, \quad \bar{y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i}{n}
$$

where \( n \) is the number of data points.

2. **Slope \( m \)**:

$$
m = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

3. **Intercept \( b \)**:

$$
b = \bar{y} - m \cdot \bar{x}
$$

These coefficients are then used to predict future temperature anomalies by substituting future years into the linear equation.

## Data Explanation
The `sea_surface_temperature.csv` file contains historical data structured as follows:
- **Year**: The year in which the temperature anomaly was recorded.
- **Anomaly**: The temperature difference (in °F) relative to a baseline period (e.g., 1951-1980). Positive values indicate temperatures above the baseline, while negative values indicate below-baseline temperatures.

### Data Source
The data used in this project was obtained from the [EPA's Climate Change Indicators in the United States](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-surface-temperature), specifically the **Sea Surface Temperature** indicator.

### Example Data
```
Year,Anomaly
1880,-0.418
1881,-0.330
1882,-0.344
...
2023,1.161
```

## Baseline Definition
The baseline is a reference period used to calculate anomalies. For this project, the baseline is typically set to **1951-1980**, which represents a "normal" climate period. Anomalies indicate how much the temperature in a specific year deviates from this baseline.

## C++ Code: `forecast.cpp`
The C++ program reads the CSV file, processes the data, computes the linear regression coefficients, and forecasts future temperature anomalies for the next 100 years.

### Key Components
- **Data Parsing**: Reads the CSV file and extracts the `Year` and `Anomaly` columns.
- **Linear Regression Calculation**: Computes the slope and intercept using the least-squares method.
- **Forecasting**: Predicts temperature anomalies for years 2024 to 2124 using the regression model.
- **Output**: Prints the historical and forecasted data in CSV format to `output.csv`.

## How to Run the C++ Code
1. **Compile the C++ code**:
   ```bash
   g++ -o forecast forecast.cpp
   ```
2. **Run the executable** and redirect output to a CSV file:
   ```bash
   ./forecast > output/output.csv
   ```

## Python Visualization: `plotter.py`
The Python script reads the `output.csv` file generated by the C++ code and plots the data.

### Plot Features
- **Historical Data**: Shown as a blue line with markers.
- **Forecasted Data**: Shown as a red dashed line.
- **Baseline Reference**: A black dashed line at `0°F` to indicate the baseline.

### Key Python Libraries Used
- `pandas`: For data reading and manipulation.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting the data.

### How to Run the Python Script
Ensure that the `output.csv` file is in the `output/` directory and run:
```bash
python3 plotter.py
```

## Expected Output
1. **C++ Program**: Outputs historical and forecasted temperature anomalies in CSV format.
2. **Python Script**: Generates a plot showing:
   - Historical temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2023.
   - Forecasted anomalies from 2024 to 2124.
   - A baseline line for reference.

## Sample Visualization
The plot will show a clear trend of temperature anomalies relative to the baseline. Historical data will be in blue, forecasted data in red, and a horizontal line at `0°F` will represent the baseline.

## Limitations and Considerations
- **Linear Assumption**: The model assumes a linear relationship between the years and temperature anomalies, which may not capture non-linear or cyclical climate patterns.
- **External Factors**: The model does not account for variables such as greenhouse gas emissions, volcanic activity, or solar cycles, which can influence climate data.

## Enhancements
- **Advanced Modeling**: Future iterations could incorporate machine learning algorithms (e.g., polynomial regression, ARIMA models) for more accurate predictions.
- **Additional Data**: Using more features (e.g., CO2 levels, solar radiation) could improve the model's predictive power.

## Conclusion
This project provides an end-to-end solution for analyzing, forecasting, and visualizing temperature anomalies. By combining C++ for data processing and Python for visualization, it delivers a comprehensive view of climate trends and future projections.
